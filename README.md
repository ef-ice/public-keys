# public-keys
Public keys that are used to provide access to VMs

## Workflow
* Please add your public keys, one per line

* Once added, please regenerate the sha512 file too using the following command 

  ``` sha512sum authorized_keys ```

* Create a pull request

It takes a maximum of 30 minutes at the moment once the PR is merged before you get access to the VMs.
